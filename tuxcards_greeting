Before this bug fix, if you are running two copies of Tuxcard with the same document open, one would over-write the changes by other.<br />	Other changes are in detailed change log.<br /><span style="font-weight:600">Known issues:</span><br /><span style="font-weight:600">-Fails to startup:</span> In some case, Tuxcard fails to startup, this means it runs as a process, but does not display any window. This is quite rare and has been noticed after hibernate. Locking and unlocking the desktop or a reboot fixes this.<br /><span style="font-weight:600">-Password reprompt:</span> There has been a rare occurence of the password prompt coming back again. This went away after a disable and reenabling encryption.<br /><span style="font-weight:600"><br />TuxCards v2.0, released in June 2006<br />New features:<br /> </span>-File encryption. This encryptes all the entries in the file and requires password on load. Accessible through toolbar, File menu and shortcut: CTRL+E<br /> -Change text color for a single note or subtree of notes. New entries get subtree color of the parent, if set.<br /> -Added a statusbar item for total number of notes.<br /> -Added a dialog box under About menu to show current keyboard shortcuts.<br /><br />The original TuxCards release 1.2 was in June 2004 by Alexander Theel (www.tuxcards.de). I added a few features I really wanted and fixed some bugs and minor issues.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:600">Requirements: </span>qt-3.3.4 or above.<br /><br />							Thanks<br />						Amit D.

<p>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />		       Version 2, June 1991<br /><br /> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br /><br />			    Preamble<br /><br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br />software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br />General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br />Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br />using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br />the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br />your programs, too.<br /><br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br />if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br />in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br /><br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br />These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br />distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br /><br />  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br />gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br />you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br />source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br />rights.<br /><br />  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br />(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br />distribute and/or modify the software.<br /><br />  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br />that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br />software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br />want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br />that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br />authors' reputations.<br /><br />  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br />patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br />program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br />program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br />patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br /><br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />modification follow.<br /> <br />		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br /><br />  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br />a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br />under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br />refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br />means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br />that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br />either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br />language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br />the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br /><br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br />running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br />is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br />Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br />Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br /><br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br />source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br />conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br />copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br />notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br />and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br />along with the Program.<br /><br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br />you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br /><br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br /><br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br /><br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br />    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br />    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br />    parties under the terms of this License.<br /><br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br />    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br />    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br />    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br />    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br />    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br />    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br />    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br />    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br />    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br /> <br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br /><br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />collective works based on the Program.<br /><br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br />with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />the scope of this License.<br /><br />  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br />under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br />Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br /><br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br />    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br />    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br /><br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br />    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br />    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br />    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br />    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br />    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br /><br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br />    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br />    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br />    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br />    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br /><br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br />code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br />associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br />control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br />special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br />anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br />form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br />operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br />itself accompanies the executable.<br /><br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br />access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br />access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br />distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br /> <br />  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br />except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br />otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br />void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br />However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br />this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br />parties remain in full compliance.<br /><br />  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br />Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />the Program or works based on it.<br /><br />  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br />Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br />these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br />this License.<br /><br />  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br /><br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br />any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br />apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br />circumstances.<br /><br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />impose that choice.<br /><br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br /> <br />  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br />may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br />those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br />countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br />the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br /><br />  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br />of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br />be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />address new problems or concerns.<br /><br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br />later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br />either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br />Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br />this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br />Foundation.<br /><br />  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br />programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br />to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br />Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br />make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br />of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br />of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br /><br />			    NO WARRANTY<br /><br />  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br />FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br />OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br />PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br />OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br />MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br />TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br />PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br />REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br /><br />  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br />REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br />INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br />OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br />TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br />YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br />PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br />POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br /><br />		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /></p>
